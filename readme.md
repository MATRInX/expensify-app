# EXPENSIFY APP

This app have been created when I was learning React on Udemy course.
Application allows you to save information about your expenses on database related to your gmail account.
It was first app which I wrote from the very beginning of course with teacher assist.
In this project we have used following technology:

+ React
+ Simple server with Express
+ React-Redux
+ React Modal
+ React-Router
+ SCSS (BEM)
+ Jest (for testing)

## Instalation

If you want to check how it's work on your local machine just clone my repository:

```git
git clone git@github.com:MATRInX/expensify-app.git
```

## Usages

As I mentioned above in this app after authentication with gmail account you have access to database
with your expenses with full functionality for filter, edit etc.
You can add new expenses, edit these which are already in database or delete them.

## Pros and cons

This app and this React course gave me really big programming experience and thanks to that course I have learnt
React, many other libraries and I consolidate my knowledge about ES6.
In this app I took my first steps in modern web app development. I have learnt also many good practices for programming. It was second big app during this course and writing it from begin to an end gave me a lot of fun.

There is no weak parts in this app because idea and solution was not mine - it helps me a lot so I am really grateful for my Udemy teacher for this course!
